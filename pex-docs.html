Documentation</H1>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="about-the-pex-plugin"></A>About the
PEX Plugin</H2>
<P>
The PEX plugin is used to replace the default SIP shift register.
PEX allows up to 128 stations to be controlled by the SIP irrigation controller.
</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Note: Only the MCP23017 has been tested with actual hardware.</STRONG><br>
Supported hardware: pcf8574 (8 ports), pc8575 (16 ports), mcp2308 (8 ports), mcp23017 (16 ports).<BR>
It also provides a simulated bus that allows for test/demo of the PEX plugin.
<P>
The maximum number of devices (any combination) cannot exceed eight.
</P>
<BR>
<P>
When Autoconfigure is enabled, PEX scans the I2C bus at well known addresses (0x20 through 0x27)
for devices that respond to a bus write with an ACK handshake. All devices found are assumed to be of the
same type. The discovered devices are sequentially mapped to the SIP stations using the span
(8 or 16) of the selected default IC type.
</P>
<BR>
<P>
If Autoconfigure is disabled, PEX uses the last configuration saved to permanent storage to
configure the PEX controller.<BR>
There is no editor to manually configure the device configuration. The following describes a kludgy
workaround:
</P>
<OL>
	<LI>On the PEX plugin page select "Demo mode", Autoconfigure, and specify the device type
		for your hardware that needs to be manually configured.</LI>
	<LI>Click the "SAVE" button. This will create a device configuration that satisfies the
		SIP requirements for number of stations.</LI>
	<LI>Return to the PEX plugin page and deselect autocofigure, then click the "SAVE" button.
		This will save the current device configuration to permanent storage.</LI>
	<LI>Using your favorite text editor, open the file SIP/data/pex-config.json. Replace every
		occurrence of "SimulatedBus" with the bus id for your controller (either "0" or "1").
		Note that this value is a quoted string. Most users will use the value "1" since nearly
		all Raspberry Pi's use bus id "1" for the I2C bus.</LI>
	<LI> Save the modified file and restart SIP.</LI>
<OL>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="about-the-pex-files"></A>
The plugin includes the folowing files:</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><STRONG>pex.py</STRONG><BR>
		This python program provides the entry point for the PEX plugin.
		It provides the fiddly bits needed to integrate PEX into the SIP UI.<BR>

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><STRONG>port_extender.py</STRONG><BR>

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><STRONG>io_devices.py</STRONG><BR>
		Python module used to control the supported devices

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><STRONG>pex.html</STRONG><BR>
        This file is a web.py template that creates the user interface for the plugin.

<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="using-the-pex-plugin"></A>Using the
pex plugin</H2>
<P>This plugin is disabled by default. If you are reading this, the
PEX plugin is probably enabled on your system. Otherwise you can
enable it using the plugin manager or by setting the group
permissions of the <STRONG>pex.py</STRONG> file to <STRONG>executable</STRONG>.
Once it is enabled, and the SIP program has been restarted, You can
verify it is working by selecting it from the PLUGINS drop down menu
of the main program&rsquo;s web interface. You should be taken to the
PEX home page.
